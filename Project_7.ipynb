    "In this project, our goal was to implement our own semaphore class in Python and utilize it to solve the producer-consumer problem. Specifically, we utilized our semaphore to implement a solution to the dining philosophers problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Results/Discussion: \n",
    "The code below tests my own implementation of the semaphore class, and we know it works because it has a similar output to the Buffer class we utilized in class. Specifically, we see no errors especially pop with empty list error, the buffer never exceeds 10, and every item added to the buffer is removed at the end of each run.\n"
